Crypt::PwGen
==================

A perl interface for pwgen, a password generator by Theodore Ts'o
<tytso@alum.mit.edu>.

As pwgen itself does not come as a library, a slightly modified source
package is required; feel free to fetch it from github:
https://github.com/bnutzer/pwgen

See the perl documentation (perldoc Crypt::PwGen) for more information
and usage.


Installation
============
To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install


Bugs
====

pwgen is an executable program; linking its object files to an .so file
does not make it a good shared library. Especially, it relies on a
global variable.

When modifying the lib's behavior through the pwgen_XX functions, you
may experience all kinds of weird and undesirable behavior, including
segfaults or insecure passwords.
